</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The diagnosis and treatment of cardiac conditions often involve complex and time-consuming procedures. Certain types of arrhythmias and abnormal heartbeats may only surface a few times per day and under specific circumstances, making them difficult to detect in a timely manner. Early diagnosis is crucial for the successful treatment of these conditions, yet current methods struggle to identify the subtle signs of early-stage diseases.</p>
<p>One of the shortcomings of current practices is the use of short-duration, high-quality ECG recordings, typically lasting between one to twenty-four hours. These multi-channel ECG devices, while providing precise readings, are non-portable, and hence, the recordings are typically made while the patient is at rest. However, some abnormal heart rhythms only become noticeable when the patient is active or under some form of exertion, thus escaping detection by these stationary devices.</p>
<p>This led me to ponder on a solution that would not only be wearable but also equipped to handle and process large volumes of ECG data. These wearable devices, while suffering from certain downsides like lower channel count and a higher risk of artifact interference, could record ECG data continually and under varying physical conditions. With technological advances, it's possible to filter out the artifacts and retain the meaningful ECG data.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is the processing of this data. With weeks' worth of ECG readings, it's not feasible for a cardiologist or technician to review all the data manually. Hence, the need for a model that could automatically triage the ECG data, alerting the medical staff to the sections of interest only.</p>
<p>As far as I know, no open-source reference standard for this exists. Creating such a model would enable a faster diagnosis process, significantly reducing the time and resources currently invested in sifting through ECG data. If implemented, this technology could transform the field of cardiology by providing a practical, efficient, and patient-friendly solution to the problem of timely and accurate diagnosis.</p>
<p><img alt="VAE decoder running in matplotlib" src="/images/ecg_vae.gif"></p>
<p><strong>One potential approach:</strong> I've had the opportunity to look into this a little back in Oct 2019 and found that if you crop a small region (1 or 2 seconds around each beat), so that you have one wavelet per beat and pre-process is appropriately then you can train a VAE with a small number of latent space parameters (5 in my test case) that is able to reproduce most of the features of each beat. More interestingly: if you use some non linear clustering algorithm (I think I used t-SNE) to project the 5D data onto a 2-D image and color the  values by the annotation you will find that each cluster of points is of the same color with less than 5% contamination. This is amazing because it means that the 5 latent space values can be combined to classify the beat pathology. Above is a GIF of the decoder part of the VAE, where one can manually modify the latent space values and see the resulting waveform.</p>                </article>
